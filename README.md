# diskvscontroller
A way to list all hard disks on linux system, and see which controller they are attached to

# Do feel free to modify, use, distribute however you wish
# However, you do so accepting that :
# No liability WHATSOEVER rests with me in you using
# I'll only take credit for when it works, thanks !

# diskvscontroller.script.sh
# --------------------------
#
# I wrote this because I got bored hunting on stackoverflow and superuser
# looking for a simple and quick way to determine which of my disks
# were attached to which of my controllers
#
# Basically it's a quick and dirty query using udevadm
#
# Future improvements - Like to list the controller, then drives attached
# but it's simpler to query the drives then lookup controller each time
# - Like to have info presented a bit more concisely / orderly

# Tested - Debian Stretch 4.9.0-6-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.88-1+deb9u1 (2018-05-07) x86_64 GNU/Linux
